# Panasonic Blu-ray Player Binding

This binding connects Panasonic Blu-ray players from 2011/2012 and UHD Blu-ray players from 2018 to openHAB.  
Supported Blu-ray models: DMP-BDT110, DMP-BDT210, DMP-BDT310, DMP-BDT120, DMP-BDT220, DMP-BDT320, DMP-BBT01 & DMP-BDT500.  
Supported UHD models: DP-UB420, DP-UB820 & DP-UB9000.  

The control protocol of these players is undocumented and all understanding of how the protocol works was learned from Internet forum posts and observing network traffic between the player and its iOS/android apps.
Currently the binding can send remote control commands to the player and retrieve some basic playback status information.
It is possible that more functionality could be added in the future if additional information about the protocol is discovered.

It is understood the reason that players released after 2012 no longer had the http control protocol was that Panasonic outsourced its firmware development to another entity.
It is believed that they resurrected some of their in-house technology for the UHD player firmware and with it the 2011/2012 http control protocol was again implemented on the 2018 UHD player line.

To enable network remote control of the player, configure the following player settings:  
**Player Settings/Network/Network Settings/Remote Device Settings**  
Then make sure you have the following values set:  
**Remote Device Operation: On**  
**Registration Type: Automatic**  

To enable the binding to control the player while off (network active while off), Quick Start mode must be On as follows:  
**Player Settings/System/Quick Start: On**  

## Supported Things

There are two supported thing types, which represent either a BD player or a UHD player.
A supported Blu-ray player uses the `bd_player` id and a supported UHD Blu-ray player uses the `uhd_player` id.
Multiple Things can be added if more than one player is to be controlled.

## Discovery

Auto-discovery is supported if the player can be located on the local network using UPNP.
Otherwise the thing must be manually added.

## Binding Configuration

The binding has no configuration options, all configuration is done at Thing level.

## Thing Configuration

The thing has a few configuration parameters:

| Parameter | Description                                                                                           |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| hostName  | The host name or IP address of the Blu-ray player. Mandatory.                                         |
| refresh   | Overrides the refresh interval of the player status. Optional, the default and minimum is 10 seconds. |
| playerKey | For UHD players, to enable authentication of control commands, a key for the player must be specified.|

Some notes:

* Not all commands work on all players (ie: Power does not work on DMP-BDT110)
* Not all status information is available from all players (ie: playback elapsed time not reported by some players)
* On some players the time and chapter information is only available when playing a Blu-ray disc (not DVD or CD)
* The openHAB server must be on the same IP subnet as the player (404 response errors are sent if on a different subnet)
